# PNG Cross Section Tools

I wrote this program because i couldn't get my CAD software to calculate the area moment of inertia of some components in my project.

## How To Use

Put a png file named "image.png" in the same directory as the one you are running the software from. results will be output to the terminal.
I will improve this soon.
